This app is the result of my successful completion of this project/part of the 'Android Basics in Kotlin' course. I used starter code provided by Google Developer Training resources and then wrote additional code in Kotlin to make the app functional. You can find the course at this link: https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course

Cupcake app
=================================

This app contains an order flow for cupcakes with options for quantity, flavor, and pickup date.

data binding, LiveData, and the Jetpack Navigation component.
